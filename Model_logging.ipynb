    "### A data science approach to predict and understand the applicant’s profile to minimize the risk of future loan defaults.\n",
    "\n",
    "The dataset contains information about credit applicants. Banks, globally, use this kind of dataset and type of informative data to create models to help in deciding on who to accept/refuse for a loan.\n",
    "After all the exploratory data analysis, cleansing and dealing with all the anomalies we might (will) find along the way, the patterns of a good/bad applicant will be exposed to be learned by machine learning models. \n",
    "* Machine Learning issue and objectives\n",
    "     We’re dealing with a supervised binary classification problem. The goal is to train the best machine learning model to maximize the predictive capability of deeply understanding the past customer’s profile minimizing the risk of future loan defaults.\n",
